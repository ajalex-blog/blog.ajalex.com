Tip : Visual Studio : View White Spaces
=================================

It is very common that we leave a lot of __white spaces__ in the workspace. Few of them part of default intentations and few being unintented.
Many a times they are noticed on selecting a bunch of code or while doing a backspace operation. There could be other ways of detecting it as well, but the core idea being, it is very difficult to detect it.

There is one easy way, in fact.

Visual Studio has a handy feature, called ```View White Spaces```.

> Open Edit Menu >> Select Advanced >> Enable "View White Spaces"

There is a handy shortcut for this as well : ```Ctrl + E, S```
